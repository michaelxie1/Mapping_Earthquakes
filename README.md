# Mapping_Earthquakes
This project contains multiple branches that shows users how to create interactive maps using Javascript and API requests. Using the Leaflet.js API, a geographic map containing GeoJSON earthquake data will be created from the API calls.

Under this image, a website was created that contains earthquake information from the past 7 days. The size and colors of the circle indicates the magnitude of the earthquake, and the geographic map can change its styles from the default map to either the satelite or dark maps. This data is helpful in general as it can see trends on where Earthquakes occur and even be used to predict future possible locations. Since the information displayed shows where the earthquakes formed and what their magnitudes are, this would show someone how dangerous/likely it would be for an earthquake to occur in locations that they would travel too.
