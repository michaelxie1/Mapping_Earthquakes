# Mapping_Earthquakes
The purpose of this project is to utilize our knowledge within web development and create maps that display the magnitudes of earthquakes that occured within the past 7 days. Creating different branches to show the various ways in which we were able to call infomration from MapBox, it was easier to organize information and show the progress in which we developed the maps.
